<h1>What is outstageed?</h1>
Outstageed is a project that aims on the unexplained cases in life, for example the real truth of how people existed, this things that never had a reasonable explanation.

Outstageed works by letting everyone publish thier theories on this cases, becuase someone out thier may really have a strong explaning but don't have the voice to let it reach the destination
